Attention_is_all_you_need,.pdf,1,"1 Introduction
Recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [ 13] and gated recurrent [ 7] neural networks
in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and
transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [ 35,2,5]. Numerous
efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder
architectures [38, 24, 15].
Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output
sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden
states ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1and the input for position t. This inherently"," Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their variants such as LSTM and GRNN have been successful in sequence modeling and transduction tasks like language modeling and machine translation. These models typically compute along the positions of input and output sequences, generating a sequence of hidden states that capture temporal dependencies."
Attention_is_all_you_need,.pdf,1,"sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer
sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved
significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [ 21] and conditional
computation [ 32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental
constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.
Attention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-
tion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in
the input or output sequences [ 2,19]. In all but a few cases [ 27], however, such attention mechanisms"," The sequential nature of training examples precludes parallelization and becomes critical at longer sequence lengths due to memory constraints.

Attention_is_all_you_need,.pdf,1,"are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.
In this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead
relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.
The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in
translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.
2 Background
The goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU
[16], ByteNet [ 18] and ConvS2S [ 9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building
block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,"," The Transformer is a model architecture that utilizes an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output, allowing for more efficient parallelization and achieving state-of-the-art results in translation quality after minimal training time on powerful GPUs. This approach contrasts with traditional recurrent networks by eliminating sequential computation and instead relying on convolutional neural networks as basic building blocks to compute hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions."
Attention_is_all_you_need,.pdf,1,"the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows
in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes
it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is
reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due
to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as
described in section 3.2.
Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions
of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been"," The number of operations required for ConvS2S and ByteNet models increases linearly with distance between input/output positions, making it harder to learn dependencies. In contrast, Transformer reduces this to a constant but sacrifices effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions.

Self-attention is an attention mechanism that relates different positions within a single sequence in order to compute a representation."
Attention_is_all_you_need,.pdf,1,"used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,
textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].
End-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-
aligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and
language modeling tasks [34].
To the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying
entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-
aligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate
self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9]."," The Transformer is a transduction model that uses self-attention to compute representations of input and output without using sequence-aligned RNNs or convolution.

Attention_is_all_you_need,.pdf,1,"3 Model Architecture
Most competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [ 5,2,35].
Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., x n)to a sequence
of continuous representations z= (z1, ..., z n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output
sequence (y1, ..., y m)of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive
[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.
2"," The most competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder maps input symbol representations to continuous representations and the decoder generates output symbols one element at a time using auto-regression."

The Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully
connected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,
respectively.
3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks
Encoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N= 6 identical layers. Each layer has two
sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-
wise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [ 11] around each of
the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is
LayerNorm( x+ Sublayer( x)), where Sublayer( x)is the function implemented by the sub-layer"," The Transformer model architecture consists of stacked self-attention and point-wise fully connected layers in both the encoder and decoder.

Decoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N= 6identical layers. In addition to the two
sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head
attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections
around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention
sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This

queries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the

values.

plicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor
of1√dk. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with
a single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is
much faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized
matrix multiplication code.

dk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has
extremely small gradients4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by1√dk.
3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention
Instead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,
we found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values htimes with different, learned
linear projections to dk,dkanddvdimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of
queries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional"," The paper proposes a scaled dot product attention mechanism for larger values of dk to counteract the effect of extremely small gradients.

In this work we employ h= 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use

The model uses 8 parallel attention layers with reduced dimension for each layer, resulting in similar computational cost as full dimensionality single head attention."
Attention_is_all_you_need,.pdf,4,"3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model
The Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:
•In ""encoder-decoder attention"" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,
and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every
position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the
typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as
[38, 2, 9].
•The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values
and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the
encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the
encoder."," The Transformer model utilizes multi-head attention in three different ways - decoder-decoder attention, self-attention in the encoder and self-attention in the decoder. Decoder-decoder attention allows every position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence while self-attention in the encoder enables each position in the encoder to attend to all positions in the previous layer of the encoder."
Attention_is_all_you_need,.pdf,4,"encoder.
•Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to
all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward
information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this
inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input
of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.
3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks
In addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully
connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This
consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between."," The self-attention mechanism in the decoder allows each position to attend to all positions up to that position while preventing leftward information flow using masking. Position-wise feed-forward networks are also applied to each position separately and identically, consisting of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between."

from layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.
The dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512 , and the inner-layer has dimensionality
dff= 2048 .
3.4 Embeddings and Softmax
Similarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input
tokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-
mation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In
our model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax"," The FFN layer in this transformer architecture consists of two convolutions with kernel size 1, followed by linear transformations using different parameters from layer to layer.

during training.
4 Why Self-Attention
In this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-
tional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations

Attention_is_all_you_need,.pdf,5,"layer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we
consider three desiderata.
One is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can
be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.
The third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range
dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the
ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to
traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input"," This passage discusses three desiderata for designing a sequence transduction model, including computational complexity per layer, parallelization potential, and path length between long-range dependencies. Shortening the path lengths between positions in the input is crucial for learning long-range dependencies in these tasks."
Attention_is_all_you_need,.pdf,5,"and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [ 12]. Hence we also compare
the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the
different layer types.
As noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially
executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n)sequential operations. In terms of
computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence

Self-attention layers, which connect all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations, are faster than recurrent layers, which require O(n)sequential operations, in terms of computational complexity."
Attention_is_all_you_need,.pdf,6,"length nis smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with
sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece
[38] and byte-pair [ 31] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving
very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size rin
the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum
path length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.
A single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output
positions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k)convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,"," The paper discusses limitations in computational performance when using sentence representations with smaller dimensionality than sequence length n, commonly seen in state-of-the-art machine translation models. One approach to improve performance is by restricting self-attention to a neighborhood of size r around the output position, increasing maximum path length to O(n/r).

between any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than
recurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity
considerably, to O(k·n·d+n·d2). Even with k=n, however, the complexity of a separable
convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,
the approach we take in our model.
As side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions
from our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention"," The paper proposes a new deep learning architecture for image classification that utilizes dilated convolutions, which increase the length of the longest paths between any two positions in the network.

rate over the course of training, according to the formula:

and decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used

The first paper presents a new architecture for computer vision called ""Rethinking the Inception Architecture,"" which aims to improve image classification accuracy. The second paper, titled ""Grammar as a Foreign Language,"" proposes using grammatical structures in neural networks to improve language translation. The third paper introduces Google's neural machine translation system, which uses deep learning algorithms to bridge the gap between human and machine translation. Finally, the fourth paper presents a new approach for neural machine translation that incorporates fast-forward connections into recurrent models."
