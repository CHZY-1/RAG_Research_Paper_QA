Neural response generation is a subcate-\\ngory of text-generation that shares the objective of\\ngenerating natural-looking text (distinct from any\\ntraining instance) that is relevant to the prompt.', 'Modelling conversations, however, presents dis-\\ntinct challenges in that human dialogue, which en-\\ncapsulates the possibly competing goals of two\\nparticipants, is intrinsically more diverse in the\\nrange of potential responses (Li et al., 2016a;\\nZhang et al., 2018; Gao et al., 2019a,b). It thus\\nposes a greater one-to-many problem than is typ-\\nical in other text generation tasks such as neural\\nmachine translation, text summarization and para-\\nphrasing. Human conversations are also generally\\nmore informal, noisy, and, when in the form of\\ntextual chat, often contain informal abbreviations\\nor syntactic/lexical errors.\\nMost open-domain neural response generation\\nsystems suffer from content or style inconsis-\\ntency (Li et al., 2016b; Zhang et al., 2019; Gao', 'tency (Li et al., 2016b; Zhang et al., 2019; Gao\\net al., 2019c), lack of long-term contextual in-\\nformation (Serban et al., 2017), and blandness\\n(Li et al., 2016a; Zhang et al., 2018; Qin et al.,\\n2019). While these issues can be alleviated by\\nmodelling strategies speciï¬cally designed to boost\\ninformation content, a transformer-based archi-\\ntecture like GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2018), which\\nuses a multi-layer self-attentive mechanism to al-\\nlow fully-connected cross-attention to the full con-\\ntext in a computationally efï¬cient manner, seems\\nlike a natural choice for exploring a more general\\nsolution.

A major\\nmotive for releasing D IALO GPT is to enable re-', 'motive for releasing D IALO GPT is to enable re-\\nsearchers to investigate these issues and develop\\nmitigation strategies. In no case should inappro-\\npriate content generated as a result of using D I-\\nALOGPT be construed to reï¬ect the views or val-\\nues of either the authors or Microsoft Corporation.\\n7 Conclusion\\nWe have released an open-domain pre-trained\\nmodel, D IALO GPT, trained on massive real-world\\nReddit dataset. The package consists of a dis-\\ntributed training pipeline and several pre-trained\\nmodels that can be ï¬ne-tuned to obtain a conver-\\nsation model on a moderately-sized customized\\ndataset in few hours. D IALO GPT is fully open-\\nsourced and easy to deploy, allowing users to ex-tend the pre-trained conversational system to boot-', 'strap training using various datasets. It serves as a\\nbuilding block to novel applications and method-\\nologies. Detection and control of toxic output\\nwill be a major focus of future investigation. We\\nwill investigate leveraging reinforcement learning\\nto further improve the relevance of the generated\\nresponses and prevent the model from generating\\negregious responses.\\nAcknowledgements\\nWe would like to thank Yu Wang, Vighnesh\\nLeonardo Shiv, Chris Quirk, and the anonymous\\nreviewers for their helpful discussions and com-\\nments.\\nReferences\\nM.
