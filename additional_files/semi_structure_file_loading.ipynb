They build upon recent advances in transformer-based architectures and address challenges of content or style inconsistency, lack of long-term contextual information, and blandness. DIALOGPT improves upon GPT-2 by using a multi-layer self-attentive mechanism to allow for more efficient computation while preserving long-term dependency information. The model has higher capacity due to its deep structure (up to 48 layers) and is effective in leveraging large-scale datasets, making it a promising solution for exploring conversational neural response generation.',\n",

The pre-trained model achieves state-of-the-art results in both automatic and human evaluation, reaching near-human response quality.

The model is trained on massive web-text data and inherits from the GPT-2 transformer model with some modifications. The generation task is framed as language modeling, where the goal is to predict the next sentence in a sequence given the previous sentences. The model optimizes a single objective function that involves computing the probability of each possible next sentence given the previous sentences in the dialogue session.',\n",
       " ' The article discusses a problem with open-domain text generation models, which often generate bland and uninformative samples. To address this issue, the authors propose a maximum mutual information (MMI) scoring function that uses a pre-trained backward model to predict source sentences from given responses. The MMI function penalizes frequent and repetitive hypotheses, resulting in more informative generated text. The authors also attempt to optimize the reward using policy gradient with sample-averaged base line, but find that reinforcement learning training easily converges to a degenerate locally-optimal solution. They hypothesize that transformers can become trapped in local optima due to their strong model representation power and leave regularized RL training for future work.',\n",
